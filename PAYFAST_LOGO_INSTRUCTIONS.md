# PayFast Logo Instructions

Since I cannot create image files directly, here are your options to get a logo for PayFast:

## Option 1: Use Text Logo (Simplest)
PayFast accepts plain text as "logo", so you can just use "EduDash Pro" text which will be displayed on the payment page.

## Option 2: Create Simple SVG Logo (Recommended)
Create a simple SVG logo that's very small:

1. Go to https://www.canva.com or https://www.figma.com
2. Create a 200x200px design
3. Add text: "EduDash Pro" with your brand colors
4. Add a simple icon (graduation cap, book, etc.)
5. Export as PNG
6. Use https://tinypng.com to compress to under 50KB
7. Upload to PayFast

## Option 3: Use Existing Brand Assets
If you have an existing logo:
1. Resize to 200x200px or smaller
2. Compress using https://tinypng.com
3. Ensure file size is < 50KB
4. Upload to PayFast Dashboard > Settings > Display Settings

## Quick Logo Colors (Based on EduDash Pro Theme)
- Primary: Purple/Blue gradient
- Text: White or Dark Navy
- Background: Transparent or solid color

## Temporary Solution
For now, you can:
1. Leave logo empty (PayFast will use merchant name "EduDash Pro")
2. Or create a simple text-based logo using free tools

Would you like me to help you create a simple HTML/CSS based logo design that you can screenshot and use?
